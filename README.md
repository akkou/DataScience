## class imbalance problem
* If you can change binning that weaken imbalance data and still makes sense for a question, do so.

## Practice for longitudinal data analysis
* Use linear mixed model
[ref](https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/VA-longitudinal/private/LDAchapter.pdf)

## Practice for imputating for missing values
* [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics))
* Fill with mean, median or most frequent values (sklearn has them)
* Or each variable can be imputed by regression model with other variables as precitors

* Personal Question: Simple gaussian distribution can be utilized such as in Gaussian Process model.
